timedatex
=========

timedatex is a D-Bus service that implements the org.freedesktop.timedate1
interface. It can be used to read and set the system clock, the real-time clock
(RTC), the system timezone, and enable or disable an NTP client installed on
the system. It is a replacement for the systemd-timedated service.

The system clock is read and set with microsecond resolution, the precision is
limited mostly by D-Bus latency. When setting the clock to an absolute time, a
correction is applied for the time spent in the polkit authorization check. The
clock can be also adjusted precisely by an offset.

The RTC is read with a resolution of one second. The hwclock program is used to
set the RTC with a high precision, update the estimated drift, and change the
UTC/LOCAL setting.

The system timezone is set by creating symlink /etc/localtime to a file in the
/usr/share/zoneinfo directory.

NTP units that should be controlled by timedatex need to be listed in text
files in /etc/systemd/ntp-units.d and /usr/lib/systemd/ntp-units.d directories.
The first valid unit from the files sorted by name can be enabled/disabled and
started/stopped. Other NTP units will be disabled and stopped.

Requirements:

- glib development files
- libselinux development files (optional)
- polkit
- systemd
- hwclock from util-linux

Installation:

$ make
# make install prefix=/usr
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable timedatex.service

systemd should now start timedatex instead of systemd-timedated for the
org.freedesktop.timedate1 bus name when a client tries to connect to it.
